## Run NER inference
Here we provide the code used for training [StarPII](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starpii) and NER model for PII detection.  We also provide the code (and `slurm` scripts) used for running Inference on [StarCoderData](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/starcoderdata), we were able to detect PII in ~800GB of text in 800 GPU hours on A100 80GB.

```
To replace secrets with this [code] in StarCoderData we used the following tokens:
```
<NAME>, <EMAIL>, <KEY>, <PASSWORD>
```
To mask IP addresses, we randomly selected an IP address from 5~synthetic, private, non-internet-facing IP addresses of the same type.
